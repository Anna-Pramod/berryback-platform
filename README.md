**Real-time food intelligence to eliminate surplus at the source.**

## 🌍 Why BerryBack Exists

Food waste is not a consumer problem.  
It is not a redistribution problem.  
It is a **planning and intelligence problem**.

Globally, over **1 billion tonnes of food** are wasted each year, driven largely by:
- Overproduction
- Static demand forecasting
- Poor feedback loops between consumption and operations

Most existing solutions intervene **after surplus already exists**, offering discounts as a last-mile fix.

**BerryBack takes a fundamentally different approach.**

## 🚀 What Is BerryBack?

**BerryBack is an AI-powered food intelligence platform that helps food businesses predict, prevent, and monetise surplus *before it occurs*.**

It aligns **real-time consumer demand signals** with **food business operations**, transforming waste reduction from a reactive process into a **planning and efficiency advantage**.

> Redistribution is not the product.  
> Intelligence is.
